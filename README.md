# LSS-kernels

This is a simple code to generate LSS SPT kernels in Python. In development. Use at your own risk!

- **algebra.py**: Contains classes for manipulating simple algebraic expressions. Using sympy and its intertwined class structures was simply too much work. Written with the help of Joaquin Rohland.
- **vectors.py**: Classes for simple vector manipulations such as sums and dot products.
- **kernels.py**: Uses the recurrence relations to generate SPT kernels.
